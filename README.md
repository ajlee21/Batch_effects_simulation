# Batch_effects_simulation

**Problem:**
Most datasets are processed in batches.  These datasets are prone to technical variations due to different experimenters or other conditions -- these are called batch effects

**Question:**
Is there a limit to the number of batches from which we can recover biological signal? What is the realistic optimal number of batches to use?

**Hypothesis:**
Having either few or many batches are able to recover the biological signal 

**Impact:**
Assist in designing experiments.

**Approach:**
Use VAE to simulate data with batch effects
