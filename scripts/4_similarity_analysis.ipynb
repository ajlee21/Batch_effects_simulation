    "# Similarity analysis\n",

    "We want to determine if the different batch simulated data is able to capture the biological signal that is present in the original data:  How much of the real input data is captured in the simulated batch data?\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we want to compare the representation of the real input data and the simulated batch data.  We will use **SVCCA** to compare these two representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we apply Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis [Raghu et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.05806.pdf) [(github)](https://github.com/google/svcca) to the UMAP and PCA representations of our batch 1 simulated dataset vs batch n simulated datasets.  The output of the SVCCA analysis is the SVCCA mean similarity score. This single number can be interpreted as a measure of similarity between our original data vs batched dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, SVCCA uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to extract the components explaining 99% of the variation. This is done to remove potential dimensions described by noise. Next, SVCCA performs a Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) on the SVD matrices to identify maximum correlations of linear combinations of both input matrices. The algorithm will identify the canonical correlations of highest magnitude across and within algorithms of the same dimensionality."
